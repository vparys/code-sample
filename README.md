# Frontend Development Code Samples

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing examples of my frontend development work. This repository contains code snippets from non-public projects I have worked on. Please note that these are partial pieces of code and cannot be run independently.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### 1. `edit-form`

This folder demonstrates my work with form handling and state management in React. The examples in this directory showcase my experience with the following packages:

- **react-query**: Used for fetching, caching, and synchronizing server state.
- **react-hook-form**: Utilized for managing form state with ease and performance in mind.
- **Other utilities**: Various other React utilities and hooks are used to demonstrate efficient form handling.

### 2. `search-address-using-mapy-cz-api`

This directory contains code that integrates the **Mapy.cz API** with a real-time address autocomplete feature. The implementation leverages:

- **react-select**: Used for creating a customizable and responsive select input for the address search field.
- **Mapy.cz API**: The API is utilized to provide real-time address suggestions as the user types, enhancing user experience.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

As mentioned, the code here is extracted from larger, private projects. It serves to illustrate specific skills and approaches I use in my work. These snippets are not meant to be executed as standalone applications.
